#rsyncbackup

This project uses rsync as a backup tool, with special focus on laptops. As they are constantly on the move, laptops can not simply run a backup at a spcified time. Internet or local network might not be available at 3 o'clock every day. 

The script available here is meant to deal with this issue. It's not very complicated and doesn't require any extra software if you are on a linux or OSX machine.
